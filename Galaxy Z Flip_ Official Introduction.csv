Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the screen and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no samsung you see 
Because My money is easy come easy go, little high, little low
When I see the screen close it doesn't really matter to me, to me


Mama, just bought a phone
Put my wallet against his head, pulled my card out, now my bank is dead 
Mama, salary had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If the loan is not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
(Wallet sings) 
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, money is aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh
I don't wanna go broke

I don't need a phone i can fold as i believe i dont have any issue putting in my pocket unless you prefer placing it in a shirt pocket which is also a bad idea as you are placing a device or radiation very near to your heart. 

What we need is a tablet size device which we can fold and place in our pocket. Imagine galaxy tab s6, you can fold it and put in your pocket instead of carrying with your hand or sleeve all the time. What Microsoft did for surface neo and duo was amazing. If samsung can study from them using own technology which can improvise further. I believe that is the future. 

With 2000 dollar price tag, let presume the same price as galaxy fold. The unique selling point is phone and tablet combine as one which allow user to concentrate one instead of two devices. Then, samsung need to think how to make this device as strong as their flagship model S and Note series. IP ratings, gorilla glass, or maybe better at some point. That was my opinion. I hope samsung team will consider this.","0","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx9ibZLwVNE&lc=Ugy63aUO1gcjLZ7U3C94AaABAg"

It leaves an indention. Glass doesn't do this, so why does the screen go from flawless, to flawed just from running your fingernails over it? With the necessary gap in between the two halves of the screen, I would hate to see the phone get put into a pocket with loose change, or small items that could put the same amount of pressure on the screen as a fingernail scrape. Pretty expensive ""glass"", don't ya think?
Whatever it is....... it's a sacrifice of durability for design. That's like selling someone a house and saying, ""well, you wanted a swimming pool, jacuzzi, and hot tub right?...... So, we took the liberty of installing them! They're made out of cardboard boxes with a wax coating. Enjoy!"".
