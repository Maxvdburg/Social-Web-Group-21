4. A plastic screen? Lol, watch it breaks over time real quick.
5. A massive crease in the middle of the screen? Lol, funny.
6. No expandable storage? Lol, again, hypocrite.
7. A 2 in 1 product that is more expensive than actually buying a S10 and a Tab S5e? Lol, funny.
8. Apps will be not updated for so long because small amount of users that actually buy them? Thats the future of the Fold. 
9. ifixit, a reputable company rated the Fold 1/10 in repairability, also, dust can get in the fold very easy, making it easier to break.  Wow, so funny.
10. Small tiny screen in the front and huge bezels? I thought Samsung hates that a lot, especially in their ads. Why now? hahaa

Only people who can't think beyond buttonless slabs would even _think_ that; anyone else would just bring back older concepts (such as physical keyboards, or Nokia's wacky designs from the early 2000s) and innovate on _those_ instead, and in doing so, proving that you really _can_ teach an old dog new tricks.

Gotta admit though, I'm fascinated to see how different the Android experience is on the Galaxy Fold, compared to my BlackBerry KEYone and all my previous Samsung Galaxies. How does Android's recovery mode work (is it confined to the outer display, or can it handle the phone being opened?)? How would games like Super Mario Run adapt to the foldable displays? Can we still use MIDI ringtones? In the unlikely event that someone programs an Android game entirely in the Snapdragon CPU's native ARMv8 assembly language, what sort of graphical fidelity can we expect? What's the minimum API level that the Galaxy Fold supports (for example, if we still had the APK for a super-old Android game, like Bonsai Blast, and sideloaded it into the Galaxy Fold, would it still run?)?
Of course, the experience will also be different in a negative way, given the lack of a headphone jack and microSD card slot (the former just being common sense for customer goodwill, and the latter's been tradition since Android Cupcake, anyway)‚Ä¶ But out of curiosity, what _would_ it take to re-add them?","0","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9ydQoi2VbA&lc=UgybG82BQ6eO-DtZp2h4AaABAg"

Pengingat:

Kita telah berada di bulan Muharram, dimana bulan Muharram adalah bulan yang mulia dan istimewa. Rasulullah Ô∑∫  bersabda: 

ÿ£ŸéŸÅŸíÿ∂ŸéŸÑŸè ÿßŸÑÿµŸêŸëŸäŸéÿßŸÖŸê ÿ®ŸéÿπŸíÿØŸé ÿ±ŸéŸÖŸéÿ∂ŸéÿßŸÜŸé ÿ¥ŸéŸáŸíÿ±Ÿè ÿßŸÑŸÑŸéŸëŸáŸê ÿßŸÑŸíŸÖŸèÿ≠Ÿéÿ±ŸéŸëŸÖŸè

""Puasa yang paling afdhal setelah puasa Ramadhan adalah puasa pada bulan Allah Al-Muharram."" (HR. Muslim: 1982).

Nabi shollallahu 'alaihi wasallam telah memotivasi kita dan menyampaikan keutamaan puasa pada tgl 10 Muharram, yakni puasa ‚ÄòAsyura, yaitu menghapus dosa satu tahun yang lalu. Rasulullah Ô∑∫ bersabda:

ÿµŸêŸäŸéÿßŸÖŸè ŸäŸéŸàŸíŸÖŸê ÿπŸéÿßÿ¥ŸèŸàÿ±Ÿéÿßÿ°Ÿé ÿ£Ÿéÿ≠Ÿíÿ™Ÿéÿ≥Ÿêÿ®Ÿè ÿπŸéŸÑŸéŸâ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸéŸëŸáŸê ÿ£ŸéŸÜŸí ŸäŸèŸÉŸéŸÅŸêŸëÿ±Ÿé ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸéŸëŸÜŸéÿ©Ÿé ÿßŸÑŸéŸëÿ™ŸêŸä ŸÇŸéÿ®ŸíŸÑŸéŸáŸè

""Puasa ‚ÄòAsyura aku memohon kepada Allah Ô∑ª agar dapat menghapus dosa setahun yang lalu"". (HR. Muslim: 1162).

 Luar biasa, puasa sehari dapat menghapus dosa setahun.

Dan karena Nabi shollallahu 'alaihi wasallam juga telah berazam untuk berpuasa pada tgl 9 Muharram, namun ternyata Nabi shollallahu 'alaihi wasallam wafat sebelum menunaikannya, maka disunnahkan pula puasa pada 9 Muharram, yakni puasa Tasu'a.

Maka kita disunnahkan berpuasa Tasu'a dan 'Asyuro, yakni tgl 9 dan 10 Muharram. 

 Semoga Allah Ta'ala Memberikan kemudahan kepada kita untuk memperbanyak amal ibadah dan diterima disisi Allah Ta'ala ... Aamiin.

It was based at the time on the S3 - being able to fold in half. Using dual screens working as one & also containing 2 batteries working as one (for longer run time). I had an email back from Samsung telling me they had no plans to release such a device. Fast forward to 2019 & they have released the Galaxy Fold - phone to tablet concept. Fantastic idea Samsung, shame they took my idea & name & are now saying it was there idea... wish I'd patented my idea back in 2002, but I honestly thought Samsung would have given me some credit..

I have the Galaxy Fold and it is perfect for reading and multi tasking. My best use scenario became real when I was flying coach on my way to Company Training in the Twin Cities. While flying I used the Fold and Earbuds for reading a decades worth of historical Turbofan Engine Difficulty Reports which frequently included graphics and pictorials on the various issue involved while having Google Play music playing a downloaded lively play list in the bottom right and also having a 3rd program open in the top right. I am amazed at how nice having extra screen space is. I recently dropped into the Apple Store and uNfolded the Fold atop the Ipad Mini and realized the Fold appears to have a larger viewable area. -NOTE to the world: buy yourself a Fold and bring it on because tasks are easier with technology like this I hope even kids could have this. I find myself letting most people I meet handle it. Even at the drive thru at Del Taco while using a digital coupon on the outer screen the guy was like is that the Fold, can I see it? Sure bro but just  be careful. And in many other places I visit to I find myself showing and telling this awesome Tech. out to others, mainly at others bequest. I am sure Samsung needs to stay with THIS form factor and continue to optimize the flexable glass layer, because that to is the future. Also most ask what do you do for a living.? Bro I fix Jet Airliners and I am never more than a flip away from the Tech. manuals the Aircraft Engineers made.

The experience with Samsung customer service is terrible. 

The call centre person said that will contact you in the next day, but after my call I discovered that the person did not work in the next 4 consecutive days. 

Also each Samsung employee gives a different answer. There is  inconsistency in the information provided to the client.
